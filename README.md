# Food-Recognition
A website that recognises wasted food on your food tray through your camera

## Opening the page
To open the webpage you need to run the server.js file using node and then visit localhost at port 3000. First, open the folder scripts/backend with the terminal by writing `cd scripts/backend`. Then all you need to do is write in the terminal `node server.js`. In the end, you'll have something like this:
```bash
$ cd scripts/backend
$ node server.js
```
